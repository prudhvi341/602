In contrast, unsupervised learning is used for unlabeled datasets, where the model must identify patterns and relationships in the data without any explicit guidance.\n",
    "In supervised learning, the dataset is labeled with the correct output, while in unsupervised learning, the dataset is unlabeled, and the model must find the underlying patterns on its own.\n",
